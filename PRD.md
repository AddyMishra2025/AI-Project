# YouLearn AI – Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement
YouTube is the world's largest free learning platform — but it's chaotic.  
Learners spend 15–60 minutes just finding the right video, struggle to verify quality, and lack a structured path to build mastery. Progress tracking is absent, and motivation often drops after a few lessons.

## 2. Objective
Build **YouLearn AI**, a mobile-first AI-powered learning assistant that:
- Curates and organizes the best YouTube content.
- Creates structured learning tracks (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).
- Generates AI-powered notes, summaries, and interactive quizzes.
- Tracks progress, gamifies learning (streaks, badges).
- Shows role-specific career paths and generates shareable LinkedIn posts.

## 3. Success Metrics (HEART Framework)
- **Happiness:** 80%+ CSAT after 1 week.
- **Engagement:** 3+ learning sessions per week per user.
- **Adoption:** 50% of new users complete their first path within 7 days.
