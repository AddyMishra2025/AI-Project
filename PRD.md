- Curates and organizes top YouTube educational content.
- Structures learning tracks by skill level (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).
- Generates AI-powered notes, summaries, and interactive quizzes.
- Tracks user progress and gamifies learning (streaks, badges).
- Presents career paths linked to skills and enables shareable LinkedIn achievements.

## 3. Success Metrics (HEART Framework)
